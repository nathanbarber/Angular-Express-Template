# Angular-Express-Template
A quick start template for a routed AngularJS SPA with an ExpressJS backend. With Gulp build process


# Getting Started
Clone the project code into a folder, then open up a shell and type 'gulp listen'
This should spin up the gulp process, creating the 'prod' folder and listening for web connections on port 8080


# Editing the code
To use this template, all that you need to do is add Javascript and CSS to their respective folders in the assets directory along with adding routed view HTML pages to the views directory.
Every Javascript and CSS file should correspond to an HTML view. While the CSS files can be formatted to your discretion, the Javascript files should follow a specific format.
JAVASCRIPT: 
<code>app.controller("name_of_view", function($scope) { 
  //Code here 
});</code>
